 Inline elements are HTML elements that are displayed inline with the surrounding content, meaning they do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. 
 Some common inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, and <img>.

 Block level elements on the other hand start on a new line.

The dislplay property can be used to change an element type from block to inline or inline-block...
The <div> element in HTML is a generic container element that is used to group together other elements and to create logical divisions or sections within a webpage.
The <div> element itself does not have any specific semantic meaning and is primarily used for styling purposes or to apply JavaScript functionality.

the <span> element is an inline container which is usually used within elements, and it's used to highlight specific parts of the elements to apply styles to that part.'
the span elements can also be used in the same way like the div element if someone wants an inline container and viceversa

e.g. <p>This is a <span id="highlighted-text">highlighted</span> word.</p>
#highlighted-text {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}

The <nav> element in HTML is used to define a section of a webpage that contains navigation links. 

In HTML, the <section> element is used to define sections or groupings of content within a webpage. It is a semantic HTML5 element that helps structure the content of a webpage in a meaningful way,

Pseudo-classes, on the other hand, are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected element
Some common pseudo-classes include :hover, :focus, :active, and :nth-child().
e.g. a:hover {
  color: red;
}

Inheritance:  Inheritance is the mechanism by which styles applied to a parent element can be passed down to its children.
For example, if you set the font size of the body element to 16px, all text content inside the body element (e.g., paragraphs, headings) will inherit that font size unless explicitly overridden.


 to select an element by its id write the hash symbol followed by the id name*/

A link directs the user to another webpage or resource, while an anchor directs the user to a specific point within the same webpage. Both are used to improve navigation and user experience on websites.
A class selector can be used for multiple elements whilist an id selector can only be used once and id is declared with a # and a class with a .

p {
  font-family: "fira-sans", "times-new-Roman"; /* the second font is a fallback font*/
  text-align: center;
  color: rgb(83, 75, 75);
}

id's # are unique classes . are not

CSS box model content-
(padding:(inside space): top, right, bottom, left; border: border radius border type border color;)
padding is inside, margin is outside space.

Box-shadow property: "horizontal offset e.g. 1px"  "vertical offset e.g. 1px" "blur radius e.g. 2px" "rgb(red, gree, blue)"
Inset: this keyword creates an inset shadow making the shadow look like its inside the element, 
offset-x: Specifies the horizontal distance of the shadow from the element. Positive values move the shadow to the right, while negative values move it to the left.
offset-y: This value specifies the vertical distance of the shadow from the element
blur-radius: This value specifies the blur radius of the shadow. The larger the value, the more blurred the shadow appears.
spread-radius: This value specifies the spread radius of the shadow. Positive values cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, while negative values cause it to shrink.
color: This value specifies the color of the shadow. You can use named colors like red, hexadecimal codes like #ff0000, RGB values like rgb(255, 0, 0), or RGBA values like rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) for transparency.

In CSS, you can use the border property to define a border around an element. The border property can specify the width, style, and color of the border.
e.g. ...
#id {
    border: [border-width] [border-style] [border-color];
} colors (names(red), hexadecimal values(#rrggbb) rgb values(255, 0, 0) or hsl values(0, 100%, 50%))

<pre></pre> <!--the preformatted tag is used to output anything between it as plain text, and &gt is greater than & lt is less than-->

text-decoration: dashed or underlined or none etc...
text-transform: capitalize or lowercase or uppercase or inheret etc...

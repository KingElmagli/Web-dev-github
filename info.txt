In Git, a repository is a collection of files, directories, and version control data stored in a specific location (either locally or remotely) to manage project history and collaboration.
A folder that contains files and other folders is referred to as a directory.

 git commands

 This is a git commit! (a commit is a code snapshot)
 We have a working directory i.e. the text file and a repository which is the tracking part git does.
 Branch is where commits are stored, the master branch is the core place where the changes are saved

 To run a git command in the terminal you should start with "git", 
 To initialise a repository use (git init), to see your info about your current git project use (git status)

 git add, adds the changes to the commit, and git commit creates the commit and adds it to the branch. 
 another summary is  git add adds changes to the staging area, and git commit creates the commit and adds it to the branch.

 (git add .) to add  everything, (git add file_name) to add a specific file.
 (git commit -m "Your commit message here")

 (git log)  It shows a history of all the commits that have been made in the repository, including information such as the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

(git config) is used for managing Git configuration settings i.e. set, get or delete. 
For example, you can use (git config user.name "Your Name") to set your username in Git.

(git config --global) sets global configuration values that apply across all repositories.
For example git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"
This command sets the user email to "john.doe@example.com" globally for all repositories on your machine.

(git config --global --edit)
This command i.e. (git config --global --edit) allows you to edit the global configiration settings you set using the git config --global such as user name, email address, etc.

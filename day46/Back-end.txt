Client-side is the front-end, server-side is the back-end.

The front-end is the code which excutes on the vistor's machine, its the code which controls what the vistors see.
The languages used for the front-end are HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The back-end is the code which executes on the server which is a remote machine, it's the code which controls what is being served and executes behind the scenes, it may parse and store incoming data, fetch data, store file ...
To write server-side code you need a programming language which is executed by the server, not the browser because that's the front-end(client-side)
The languages used for example Python, PHP, C#, Java, Node.js etc...

A server is just a regular computer, it's called a server because it serves a website, it sends back responses to the browsers sending requests.

Node.Js is "JavaScript for server-side", it is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, enabling server-side scripting and the development of network applications.
